# Contributing

Github's issue tracker is the preferred way to make feature requests, file bug reports, ask questions, and contribute code.

You don't need to ask to make a PR, but if it's more than a handful of lines it may take longer to get reviewed than otherwise. If you're looking to make a major change, please open an issue to ask if it's appropriate for the project first.

Use your best judgement ;)
